Farty Bum: Privacy policy
Welcome to the Farty Bum game for Android!

This is a funny Android game developed by Yohanes Bogosyan. The game is available on Google Play.

As an avid Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously. I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

I have not programmed this game to collect any personally identifiable information. All data (highscore) created by you is stored on your device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the game protectes your privacy, please send me an email and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely,
Yohanes Bogosyan.
Plovdiv, Bulgaria.
